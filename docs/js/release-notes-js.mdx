## Should I update?

We highly recommend regularly updating to the latest SAP Cloud SDK version. It will help you:

- Ensure access to the latest Cloud SDK features
- Keep up with the latest changes in SAP Cloud Platform
- Update client libraries giving access to latest SAP services on SAP Cloud Platform and SAP S/4HANA
- Protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future

## 3.41.0 - March 25, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.41.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/4d51cd942a184d88bd51f4385e14d7c8/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### New Functionality

- We added a convenience method to configure the proxy authorizations when building a custom `DefaultHttpDestination`.
  The `.proxyAuthorization("value")` will send `value` within the `Proxy-Authorization` header, unless that header is already set.
- The OpenAPI generator now supports the vendor extension field `x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name` in an OpenAPI specification.
  By default, the OpenAPI generator uses the `tag` of an operation to determine the Java service class name.
  In case you're not happy with the name generated from the `tag` field, and changing it is not possible, you can add `x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name` vendor extension to the `operation` section of the specification. This vendor extension will be used by the generator to derive the Java service class name.
- Enable OData requests to skip the CSRF token retrieval if the server does not require it.
  Use the method `withoutCsrfToken()` to disable the CSRF token retrieval.
- We provided experimental support for OData v2 read requests as items in a Batch request. The API is unified and similar to the OData v4 Batch request:

  ```
  BusinessPartnerService service = new DefaultBusinessPartnerService();

  BusinessPartnerFluentHelper readOperationAll = service.getAllBusinessPartner().top(10);
  BusinessPartnerByKeyFluentHelper readOperationByKey = service.getBusinessPartnerByKey("bupa9000");

  BatchResponse response = service.batch()
      .addReadOperations(readOperationAll)
      .addReadOperations(readOperationByKey)
      .executeRequest(destination);

  List<BusinessPartner> entities = response.getReadResult(readOperationAll);
  BusinessPartner entity = response.getReadResult(readOperationByKey);
  ```

### Improvements

- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update SCP Neo Java Tomcat API from `3.123.6.2` to `3.124.9.2`
    - Update SCP Neo Java TomEE7 API from `1.92.6.2` to `1.93.10.2`
    - Update [SAP CP Spring XSUAA Security Library](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/spring-xsuaa) from `2.8.4`to `2.8.7`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Minor version updates:
      - Update Spring from `5.3.3` to `5.3.4`
      - Update Spring Security from `5.4.2` to `5.4.5`
      - Update Jetty BOM from `9.4.36.v20210114` to `9.4.38.v20210224`
      - Update Woodstox Core from `5.0.3` to `5.3.0`
      - Update Netty from `4.1.59.Final` to `4.1.60.Final`
      - Update Java JWT from `3.13.0` to `3.14.0`
      - Update [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) from `2.12.1` to `2.12.2`
      - Update Apache Commons Lang from version `3.11` to `3.12.0`
      - Update JSON from version `20201115` to `20210307`
      - Update Jackson from version `2.12.1` to `2.12.2`
- The OData type-safe client (VDM) for OData V4 services of newest release [2102 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2021/02/sap-s4hana-cloud-2102-empowering-businesses-seize-opportunities/) and FPS1 of SAP S/4HANA on-premise 2020 now also supports static fields for accessible properties on `VdmComplex` types.

### Fixed issues

- We fixed an issue with OData V2 read requests where an error message was incorrectly written to the log when using filters.
  The error messages are no longer logged unless it is applicable:

  > Registered custom filter expression cannot be used when performing the OData V2 request with toRequest() or executeRequest().

  > Registered custom filter expression cannot be used when performing the OData V2 request with execute().

- Fix an issue with OData response handling where deserialization of one-to-many properties failed for primitive and complex data types.


## Compatibility Notes

- [core] Use `HEAD` instead of `GET` when fetching CSRF tokens. Change the URL for CSRF token fetching in OData requests from the service URL to the request URL.
- [test-util] Use `HEAD` for `mockHeaderRequest()` to align with the core behaviour.
- [core] Remove experimental `Exclude` type, which was accidentally exposed as non-experimental.
- [openapi-generator] Rename the CLI generator command from `generate-openapi-client` to `openapi-generator`.
- [openapi-generator] Rename some generator options and default behavior of those options ([details](./knowledge-base/adr/0020-generator-options.md)).

## New Functionality

- [openapi-generator] **Release the SAP Cloud SDK OpenAPI generator.**
- [core] Support custom axios options for all request builders.
- [core] Support disabling csrf token request as an option for all request builders.
- [odata] Support unary operator `not` in the `filter()` of OData request builders.

## Improvements

- [odata] Allow using filter functions with boolean return types directly in the `filter()` of OData request builders without `equals(true)`.
- [odata-generator] Disable the `execute` function, when an entity type is shared by multiple entity sets and is used as the return type of function/action imports.
- [openapi-generator] Introduce `verbose` option to enable verbose logging.
- [openapi-generator] Introduce `overwrite` option to allow overwriting of existing files.
- [openapi-generator] Introduce `include` option to allow copying files to the generated clients.
